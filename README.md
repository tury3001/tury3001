### About me

👋 My name is Alejandro and I'm a web developer. I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and I've been working in programming for 20 years.

## Programming

I started coding with BASIC and Assembler when I was at school 👦. Then, I continued learning to code in C.

At the university I discovered a wide range of technologies like Assmbler 8086, Assembler IBM 370, Pascal, Java, C#, C++ and Prolog among others. But before that I already had been researched and tested web programming languages and frameworks 💪. That was when I decided to be a web developer.

Since then I've been working mostly with PHP ✨ and its ecosystem (WordPress, Zend Framework, Laravel, OpenCart and PrestaShop), but in the last years I set aside PHP and moved to Node.js ✨ and all the JavaScript world 🌏.

Even though I consider myself a back-end developer 🧌, I like to code in front-end technologies too 👨‍🎨. Nowadays I enjoy coding in React and Vue.js. In fact, many of my repositories in GitHub are front-end projects.

Currently I work mostly with Node.js, TypeScript, NestJS and React.

## Jobs
I worked as a senior developer, tech lead, project leader and project manager. Even though I can manage projects I rather prefer to be close to my team and help them building apps contributing with my technical knowledge 🧠.

## Current job
I work as a freelancer 👨‍💻. So if you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find me, maybe you can hire... me.
