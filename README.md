### About me

👋 My name is Alejandro and I'm a web developer. I have been working in programming for 20 years.

## Programming history

I started coding with BASIC and Assembler when I was at school 👦. Then, I continued learning to code in C.

At the university I discovered strange and new technologies and finally I arrived to the web development world 💪.

Since then I've been working mostly with PHP ✨ and its ecosystem (WordPress, Zend Framework and Laravel), but in the last years I set aside PHP and moved to Node.js ✨ and all the JavaScript world 🌏.

Even though I consider myself a back-end developer 🧌, I like to code in front-end technologies too 👨‍🎨. Nowadays I enojoy coding in React and Vue.js. Many of my repositories in GitHub are front-end projects.

Currently I continue learning 📚 about JavaScript and all its ecosystem focusing in Node.js.

## Job history
I worked as a senior developer 👍, tech lead 👍, project leader 👍 and project manager 🤮. Yeah, I didn't like that last role. The thing is I like to be close to my team and help them building apps contributing with my technical knowledge 🧠.

## My job now
I work as a freelancer 👨‍💻. So if you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find me, maybe you can hire... me.
